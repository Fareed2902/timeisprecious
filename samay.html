        <h1>TIME IS PRECIOUS</h1>
        <h2>If you reached here, this is for you khushi</h2>
        <p>
            Took you long enough to deocde that french and type in the name of the website line by line to come here to read this text.
			It really took a lot of time khushi, time.
			Gone, those minutes have gone, evaporated into thin air.
            that's the importance of time I wanna tell you, all these fights, everything will ultimately result in a bigger loss
            The loss of time. Please try to understand it khushi, we don't got much time. 
            This was the meaning of the first line, if I were time, I'd be all yours coz that is what you lack. 
            What is the second line again, anger huh?
            Clue to the second half of the letter, ALSO DO READ EVERYTHING VERY CAREFULLY, EVEN THE DESCRIPTIONS
